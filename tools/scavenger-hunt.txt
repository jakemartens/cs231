This is my response for the assignment due 4/2. I am working on  my MacBook running macOS 11.2.2.
1.  I used the command "ipconfig getifaddr en0" to get my IP address "137.22.177.19". Online it says that "en0" is for wireless connections and "en1" is for wired. I am using Wi-Fi, so "en1" did not return anything.
2. The "ping" command followed by the host name returns the IP address, although I did have to terminate the command as it kept returning the same response. I also was able to use "nslookup" to achieve similar results, although in a more presentable form.
3. In terminal we can write "host [ip]" where [ip] is replaced with an IP address.

7. We use "curl -L [url] [filename]" where [url] is the url of the desired webpage and [filename] is what we want to name the file. In some documentation I read, the -L switch was not used, but in my tests, each call returned a message saying moved permanently. The -L automatically redirects to the correct location. The filename should also be a .html file in order to open properly.
8. We can use "curl -I [url]" where [url] is replaced with the url of the web page whose headers we are trying to access.
